CS3010 Lab Assignment 5

---Overview---

This ZIP contains four files (excluding README). The calculator.py file contains source code for a fully functional
calculator that can do simple calculations (i.e. addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), as well as simple
graphing and graph manipulation. The three .png files are screenshots of the application.

---Launching---

1. Ensure that you have python 3 installed (visit www.python.org/downloads for the latest version of python).
2. With the command prompt or powershell, make sure you are in the directory containing the files.
3. Use the following command to run the program:
    python calculator.py

---Usage---

Simple Calculator:
Select the operator you want, then click on the operand boxes and enter you desired numbers. Number entry can be done
either with your keyboard or the numpad UI. Additionally, fraction results can be toggled on if you wish. Once ready,
hit return on your keyboard or click the equal sign in the numpad UI. 

History:
Click the show history button to bring up a window containing the last calculation you did (if applicable). Keeping the
history window open allows the calculator to add successful calculations to it, which can easily be copied. To clear the
history, close the history window and reopen it.

Simple Graph:
Click the open graph button to bring up the graphing window. There are two options you can select at the top: simple functions
or trigonometric functions. By default, simple functions is selected. Whichever option you have selected will show a
graph with some functions plotted on it. The attributes area manipulates the functions, as outlined in the legend. The
show menu at the bottom allows you to toggle the visibility of the functions. Whenever you are ready, click the refresh
button to update the graphs.
