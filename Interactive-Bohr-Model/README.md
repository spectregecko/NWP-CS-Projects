<b>Project Overview:</b> This ZIP file contains a folder and four files (excluding README). The .html, .js and .jpg files, as well as the lib folder, are crucial. The .docx file briefly outlines what is being done for the project.
The Project's purpose is to demonstrate the concepts learned throughout the course. Specific concepts are outlined in the .docx file.

<b>Instructions:</b>
  - In order to properly view the .html files, ensure that the "lib" folder exists and contains the webgl-utils.js, webgl-debug.js, cuon-utils.js, and cuon-matrix.js files. If you do not have these files, you can get them from myClass.
  - Open the .html files using FireFox. You will initially not see anything.
  - Open a new tab and type in the address bar "about:config". Accept the risk and continue.
  - Search for the preference "security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy" and set this to false.
  - Go back to the previous tab and reload the page. You should be able to see an image. If not, ensure you have followed the steps correctly or use another browser that is less strict in local images.
  - To view the code (for both .html and .js files), right-click and select "Edit with Notepad++" (assuming it's installed on your machine).

<b>IMPORTANT:</b>
  - Firefox cannot handle drawing the orbit lines for some unknown reason, whereas every other browser can. To add insult to injury, Firefox is the only browser that can display textures (cross origin policy is easy to change).
  - To get around this, a Live Preview in Visual Studio Code was used to essentially create a local web server that enables us to display textures.
